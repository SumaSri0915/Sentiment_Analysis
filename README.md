ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis â€“ LSTM + GloVe Embeddings
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using Bidirectional LSTM and pre-trained GloVe embeddings to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative.
The model achieves 89% accuracy and is trained using TensorFlow/Keras with extensive text preprocessing in Python.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Pre-trained GloVe embeddings (300d) for semantic understanding of words

âœ… Bidirectional LSTM for better context capture in text sequences

âœ… NLTK-based text preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization, punctuation removal)

âœ… IMDB Dataset with 50,000 labeled movie reviews

âœ… Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy

âœ… Custom review prediction for real-time sentiment analysis
